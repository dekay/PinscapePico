# Pinscape Pico Expansion Boards

This folder has EAGLE plans for several circuit board designs that go with
the Pinscape Pico software.  These plans are all open-source designs that
anyone is free to build.

* <b>DIY-Friendly:</b> A comprehensive I/O controller for a virtual pinball
cabinet, with enough button ports and feedback device ports to connect just
about everything in a high-end build.  It uses entirely through-hole parts
that are easy to solder by hand, which is what makes it DIY-friendly.  The
project consists of two boards that are meant to be built and deployed as
a set (since I couldn't fit everything onto a single board, given the amount
of space that the through-hole parts take up).

* <b>Pro:</b> Another comprehensive expansion board, with essentially the
same functionality as the DIY-Friendly board set, but this time using mostly
surface-mount (SMD) parts.  The SMD parts are much smaller than the through-hole
parts used on the DIY board, allowing everything to be packed into a single
board.  The tradeoff is that a lot of the SMD parts used in the design are
difficult to solder by hand, precisely because they're so small.  So this
board is really meant to be assembled by factory equipment.  That's why I
refer to it as the "Pro" board - it's probably only going to be cost-effective
to build if you're going to build at least 50 or 100 units, and if you're
making that many, it's probably because you plan to sell them at a profit.
The designs are open-source, so you're free to do that if you have a retail
shop set up and you're willing to back your sales with warranty and technical
support (since, as they're open source, the designs themselves don't come
with any warranty).

* <b>IR-RX:</b> A small satellite board for the DIY-Friendly or Pro boards
that holds an IR receiver chip, and connects back to the expansion board
with a ribbon cable.  This lets you position an IR receiver anywhere
inside or outside your cabinet, so that it can be in line-of-sight to the
remote controls you want to point at it.

* <b>KL25Z Adapter:</b> This is for people with an existing set of the
original Pinscape KL25Z expansion boards.  The board plugs into the KL25Z
expansion boards where the KL25Z would normally go, letting a Pico take the
place of the KL25Z.  This lets you use your existing expansion boards with
the new Pinscape Pico software, and without having to re-wire your cabinet
for a new expansion board set.  (It doesn't act as a true general-purpose
KL25Z emulator, though, since it's very specifically wired for the original
Pinscape boards.)

* <b>Power Distribution:</b> A simple board designed to help tidy up your
virtual pin cab power supply wiring.  It doesn't do much other than route
power from one connector to another, but the idea is that it makes your
wiring simpler and more structured.  It does have a few active features: it
has a 6.3V regulator for powering #555 lamps (the type commonly used in
arcade pushbuttons); it provides main power switching (through a relay) for
all of the secondary supplies, based on the main PC power on/off status; and
it includes wiring for a coin door safety interlock switch for a
high-voltage (48V) supply, so that the high-voltage power is automatically
cut off whenever you open the coin door to do maintenance work inside the
cabinet.  It also features connectors that match the power connectors on the
DIY-Friendly and Pro expansion boards, again just to make the wiring tidier.
<p>
This board can be used with any I/O controller, not just Pinscape
Pico.  It does include two connectors designed especially to match
the layout of the Pinscape Pico expansion board power inputs, but
other controllers are likely to have similar power input requirements,
so it should be easy to adapt in most cases.

* <b>Flasher Panel:</b> A board designed to sit behind an RGB LED flasher
panel in a standard-width pin cab, to provide all of the electronics and
wiring to the flashers, including the five high-current (350mA) RGB LEDs.
It uses a 16-wire ribbon cable connector that matches the layout of the
Flasher port on the Pinscape Pico and KL25Z expansion boards, to make the
wiring between the controller and panel very easy and neat.  Like the Power
Distribution board, this one is designed to replace ad hoc wiring to make
your build a little tidier, and it can be used with any I/O controller.

## How to fabricate the boards

See [Fabricating the Expansion Boards](http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php?sid=expanFab)
in the [Pinscape Build Guide](http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/BuildGuideV2/BuildGuide.php).
That explains the process in terms of the original KL25Z Pinscape boards, but
it applies equally well to the Pinscape Pico boards - just substitute the EAGLE
files from this repository.


## Bills of Materials (BOMs)

Each circuit board has an accompanying BOM file, in .csv (Comma-Separated
Value) format.  To view these, open them in a spreadsheet program like
Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, or Google Sheets.

The reason these are in CSV format rather than plain text is that Mouser and
Digikey will accept them as uploads, to construct a shopping cart without a
lot of manual data entry.  But you should carefully review the results.  For
one thing, the sites aren't always perfect at matching the BOM line items to
their inventory, so check that everything looks plausibly correct before
ordering.  For another, items go out of stock.  Some items might even be out
of production by the time you order, especially if the BOM you're working
from is more than five minutes old, since the manufacturers constantly
change their product lineups.  For out-of-stock or obsolete items, you'll
have to select suitable substitutes.  For generic parts like resistors and
capacitors, substitutes should always be easy to find - just match the Ohms
or "uF" values, and the physical package type and size.  For more complex
parts, such as transistors and IC chips, it can be more difficult to select
substitutes; ask on the forums if you're in doubt, and hopefully someone
with an electronics background can point you in the right direction.
